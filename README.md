Web Page source for Development - Now using Google Maps API
This web page will geo locate when opened, placing a marker on the map for that location.
Then polygons are shown on the map with the idea that development near you is identified, red = active development, green = rezoning.
These polygons, when clicked, will show the name and have a link to the siteplans for that development.
Currently, development is obtained by requesting from the Town of Cary GIS department.
