Web Page source for Development rendered as polygons
This web page will geo locate when opened, placing a marker on the map for that location.
Then polygons are shown on the map with the idea that development near you is identified.
These polygons, when clicked, will show the name and have a link to the siteplans for that development.
Currently, development is obtained by requesting from the Town of Cary GIS department.
